# Reproducing Dynamic Load Balancing in SDN-Based Data Center Networks

## Introduction

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to reproduce a paper titled "Dynamic Load Balancing in SDN-Based Data Center Networks". The implementation leverages Mininet for topology simulation and the Floodlight SDN controller for traffic management. The primary objective is to optimize traffic flow across a Fat-Tree topology, a widely-used hierarchical structure in data centers. By dynamically adapting to real-time network utilization, this solution effectively prevents congestion and improves bandwidth usage. Researchers and developers can use this repository to replicate the behavior, validate results, and analyze network performance.

## Goals

This project aims to reproduce the following:

1. A dynamic load balancing system for traffic optimization in SDN-based data center networks.
2. Efficient bandwidth utilization in a Fat-Tree topology by redistributing traffic based on real-time link utilization.
3. A scalable and adaptive SDN solution using the Floodlight controller and RESTful APIs for performance monitoring and management.

## Key Features

- **Fat-Tree Topology**: A scalable and hierarchical topology commonly used in data centers, implemented in Mininet.
- **Floodlight Controller**: Manages traffic flows, retrieves network statistics, and enforces dynamic routing policies.
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Continuously monitors link utilization and recomputes optimal paths every 10 seconds.
- **RESTful APIs**: Utilizes Floodlight APIs to fetch topology, bandwidth, and flow statistics and apply updated flow rules.
- **Traffic Engineering**: Ensures efficient bandwidth utilization by directing traffic based on real-time link statistics.

## Algorithm

### Algorithm 1: Heuristic for Traffic Load Balancing

This algorithm dynamically minimizes the maximum link utilization for all traffic flows in the network by selecting optimal paths for each flow based on real-time link utilization data.

#### **Steps**
1. For all possible flows \( f \) in the Traffic Matrix \( T \):
   - List flows in ascending order based on priority.
   - Identify all possible paths from \( f_{\text{src}} \) to \( f_{\text{dst}} \).

2. For each path \( p \) obtained from Dijkstra's algorithm:
   - Calculate the maximum link utilization of \( p \).

3. Select the path \( p_{\text{selected}} \) with the minimum maximum link utilization.

4. Assign the flow \( f \) to \( p_{\text{selected}} \).

5. Update the flow switch table for all links in \( p_{\text{selected}} \).

6. Repeat for all flows.

Link cost is calculated as follows
    - **Link cost = f(current utilization, flow priority, and bandwidth).**

This heuristic ensures an even distribution of traffic across available paths, preventing link congestion and improving overall network performance.

## Steps to Implement and Verify Load Balancing

Execute steps 1, 2, 3, 5 before load balancing and collect results by following the verification steps listed below. Then, execute steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and collect results by following the same verification steps. This will indicate the change in bandwidth and distribution of traffic after the load balancing algorithm is applied.

### Steps:

1. **Docker Compose up to start the conatiners.  Make sure docker and docker-compose is installed**  
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    Note: [Steps to install docker and docker-compose](https://shaonmajumder.medium.com/how-to-install-docker-and-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-lts-22-04-6cdae142b9b5)

2. **Start Mininet in Terminal 1**  
    ```bash
    docker exec -it mininet bash
    mn --custom /scripts/mininet-topology.py --topo customtopo --controller=remote,ip="floodlight"
    ```

3. **Collect TCP dump on Ethernet 1 of Switch 7**  
    Open a new terminal and run:  
    ```bash
    docker exec -it mininet bash
    tcpdump -i s7-eth2 -w s7-eth1.pcap &
    ```

4. **Collect TCP dump on Ethernet 2 of Switch 7**  
    Open another terminal and run:  
    ```bash
    tcpdump -i s7-eth1 -w s7-eth2.pcap &
    ```

5. **Start the Load Balancing Script**  
    Login to the Floodlight container and run:  
    ```bash
    docker exec -it floodlight bash
    python3 /scripts/loadbalancer.py
    ```

6. **Verify Traffic in Terminal 1**  
    ```bash
    mininet> h4 iperf -s &
    mininet> h1 iperf -c h4 -u -t 30 > h1_perf_output.txt &
    mininet> h2 iperf -c h4 -u -t 30 > h2_perf_output.txt &
    ```

## Utility Scripts
1. The script is designed to manage and monitor a software-defined network by using Floodlight's REST API. It fetches switch details, topology links, static flows, and bandwidth statistics, presenting them in a readable format for analysis  [dijkstra-input-vm.py](https://github.com/ramasamy-t/SDN-DCN-Load-Balancing/blob/main/dijkstra-input-vm.py)

2. This Python script is designed to interact with the Floodlight SDN (Software Defined Networking) controller. It enables pushing and retrieving static flow entries via Floodlight's REST API. [push-flows.py](https://github.com/ramasamy-t/SDN-DCN-Load-Balancing/blob/main/push-flows.py)

3. This Python script interacts with a Floodlight SDN (Software Defined Networking) controller to monitor the network topology, analyze link utilization, compute optimal paths for traffic flows, and dynamically push flow rules to switches.

#### **Inference from Screenshots**

1. **Traffic Distribution in Wireshark**  
    Import the `s7-eth1.pcap` and `s7-eth2.pcap` files into Wireshark. This will show the traffic distribution among the two interfaces of Switch 7.

2. **Change in Bandwidth**  
    Open the files `h1_perf_output.txt` and `h2_perf_output.txt` to see the changes in bandwidth before and after applying the load balancing algorithm.
